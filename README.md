# About

Vocal learning has been an interest of mine for about two decades now, and over that period, my notes on the matter have been spread over floppy discs, CD ROMs, lots of hard drives, Google docs, [OpenWetWare](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Notebook/Vocal_learning/Vocal_learning_in_elephants) and probably other places.

With this repo, I will be trying to bring together some of those pieces that are still relevant these days, along with new pieces of research on the matter.
